# Agent TODO: TELNET Fuzzer Active Backlog

Purpose: track only active, incomplete fuzzer-improvement work for this MoonBit TELNET protocol library. Completed tasks, historical run notes, and closed reproduction details should not be kept in this file; they belong in git history, commit messages, tests, or docs.

Before and after code changes, follow `AGENTS.md`: run `moon info && moon fmt` and `moon test`; inspect generated `.mbti` diffs for intended public API changes.

## Backlog policy

- Only active todo tasks should be placed in this file.
- Remove a task from this backlog once it is completed and committed.
- Keep entries concise, actionable, and independently reviewable.
- If a fuzz case exposes a bug, reduce it into a named regression test and keep any long-term follow-up here only if work remains.

## Active work slices

### 20. Regression backlog cleanup

- Search TODOs, skipped tests, and comments created during fuzzing, using a reproducible audit command that excludes `.git` internals and non-fuzzer planning docs.
- Convert known failures into either fixed bugs or explicit documented limitations.
- Remove dead experiments and unused helpers.

Acceptance criteria:

- No unexplained TODOs or skipped fuzz tests remain.
- The cleanup audit command is documented in this run's command log.
- `moon info && moon fmt && moon test` passes.

### 21. Shared fuzzer helper research

- Investigate whether deterministic RNG, TELNET-biased input generation, observation normalization, and failure formatting can be shared between `telnet_fuzz_test.mbt`, `cmd/fuzz`, and `cmd/fuzz-native` without exposing test-only API from the public package.
- Inspection on 2026-05-24 confirmed intentional helper duplication across the fast tests and both runnable harnesses; document exactly which duplication should remain and why if package boundaries make sharing awkward.
- Preserve fast default tests and keep `cmd/fuzz` and `cmd/fuzz-native` runnable.

Acceptance criteria:

- Helper drift risk is reduced or explicitly documented.
- No public TELNET API is added solely for fuzz internals.


### 22. Native coverage-guided fuzzer validation

- Run the `cmd/fuzz-native` harness with an installed coverage-guided engine, preferably AFL++ via `CC=afl-clang-fast tools/build-fuzz-native.sh`, and record any required command refinements.
- If honggfuzz support is worthwhile, add a file-path input mode or checked wrapper rather than relying on undocumented shell redirection.
- Consider a persistent/in-process C shim only if it can stay isolated from the public TELNET API and normal tests.

Acceptance criteria:

- At least one coverage-guided engine command is validated end-to-end or blockers are documented.
- Any crash is reduced to a named deterministic regression test.
- Default `moon test` behavior remains fast and deterministic.

## Suggested recurring-agent loop

For each cron run:

1. Read this file and `AGENTS.md`.
2. Inspect repository state and recent changes.
3. Add or refine only active todo tasks when new meaningful fuzzer work is discovered.
4. Pick the highest-value incomplete slice that can be finished in one run.
5. Implement tests first when practical.
6. Fix discovered bugs or document limitations.
7. Run `moon info && moon fmt` and `moon test`.
8. Remove completed tasks from this file; keep only remaining active work.
9. Commit the completed work.
